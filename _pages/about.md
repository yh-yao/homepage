I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student in [Electrical Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University, working with Prof. [Carlee Joe-Wong](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/cjoewong/) who leads the [Learning, Incentives, and Optimization for Networked Systems(LIONS)](https://research.ece.cmu.edu/lions/index.html) research group. My research interests include <b>Personalized Federated Learning</b> and <b>Graph Representation Learning in social networks</b>. 

Before joining CMU, I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at the IEEE Honor Class from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, supervised by Prof. [Xinbing Wang](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~wang-xb/) and [Luoyi Fu](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~fu-ly/), in 2019.

I am always open for collaborations. If you have some interesting ideas, feel free to contact me!
